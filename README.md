# Simon Game

## Objective/Acknowledgments

This project was created as a practical exercise to deepen understanding of jQuery and its functionalities. By implementing the classic Simon game, various aspects of jQuery, such as event handling, DOM manipulation, and animation, were explored and applied in a real-world scenario.

## How to Play

The Simon Game is a classic memory game where players need to remember and replicate a sequence of colors.

1. To start the game, press the key A on your keyboard. The game will begin at Level 1.
2. Simon will give the first signal by lighting up one of the colored buttons.
3. Remember the color sequence and click on the buttons in the same order.
4. If you click the correct sequence, Simon will give you another signal with an additional color added to the sequence.
5. Repeat the sequence, remembering the new color added by Simon.
6. Continue this pattern as the game progresses to higher levels.
7. If you click the wrong color or the wrong sequence, the game ends, and you can restart by pressing the key A again.

## How It Works

- The game starts when the key A is pressed.
- Each level adds a new color to the sequence.
- Players must remember the sequence and replicate it by clicking the colored buttons.
- If the player clicks the correct sequence, the game proceeds to the next level.
- If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, and they can restart by pressing key A.
  - Sounds and visual cues enhance the gaming experience.
  - jQuery is used for DOM manipulation and event handling.

## Game Controls

- Keyboard: Press key A to start or restart the game.
- Mouse: Click on the colored buttons to replicate the sequence.
